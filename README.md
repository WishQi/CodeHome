For some reasons, I love do some coding to solve the problems in some OJ websites.

And it is a coincidence that I met the LeetCode. The problems there are so difficult that I cannot solve it but are still a little challenging for me. Therefore, I love it. Otherwise, the CodeJam's problems are more challenging.

All the name of the projects in this responsitory is as the same as the name of the problems in LeetCode or CodeJam.

Wish that I can make some progress.
